# InVesalius - UWO modification for use by Aaron So PhD

Added a tagging feature and auto crop that allows for the labeling of stenosis and the pre/post lesson sample points when using flow velocity to diagnose coronary artery disease. Collaboration with DAI Vera which calculates blockage based on the pressure difference. Additionally improves the command line functionality of the application when running on a docker container which is included in most builds.
